# Framework and Technology Selection Rationale

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic technology choices made for the Integration Gateway, directly aligned with seven core business requirements. Each technology selection addresses specific challenges while maintaining enterprise-grade quality and maintainability.

## Core Requirements and Technology Mapping

### 1. Read Operation Caching Requirements

**Business Need**: Reduce upstream service load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

**Technology Solutions**:
- **MediatR Pipeline + CachingBehaviour**: Provides type-safe, business-level caching with conditional execution based on request attributes (`[Cacheable]`)
- **IMemoryCache**: High-performance in-process caching with TTL management and automatic eviction
- **Configuration-Driven Strategy**: Supports different TTL policies per query type (5 seconds for demo, configurable per business needs)

**Benefits**:
- Zero code changes required for caching new queries (attribute-based)
- Type-safe cache key generation prevents runtime errors
- Business-level cache control without HTTP-level complexity

**Implementation Example**:
```csharp
[Cacheable("ProductListExpirationSeconds")]
public record GetProductsV2Query(int Page, int PageSize) : IRequest<ProductListV2Response>;
```

### 2. Write Operation Idempotency Requirements

**Business Need**: Ensure exactly-once semantics for critical business operations to prevent duplicate processing.

**Technology Solutions**:
- **Custom IdempotencyService**: Implements composite key strategy (`Idempotency-Key + HTTP method + body hash`)
- **SemaphoreSlim**: Provides thread-safe concurrency control with fast-fail semantics (3-second timeout)
- **ConcurrentDictionary**: High-performance, thread-safe in-memory storage for idempotency state
- **TTL Management**: 15-minute expiration with 5-minute cleanup intervals

**Benefits**:
- Prevents duplicate processing during network retries
- Handles high-concurrency scenarios safely
- Memory-efficient with automatic cleanup
- Fast-fail approach prevents resource exhaustion

**Implementation Strategy**:
```csharp
// Composite key ensures uniqueness across operations
var key = $"{idempotencyKey}_{httpMethod}_{requestHash}";
using var semaphore = _semaphores.GetOrAdd(key, _ => new SemaphoreSlim(1));
await semaphore.WaitAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3), cancellationToken);
```

### 3. API Version Forward Compatibility Requirements

**Business Need**: Support multiple API versions simultaneously without breaking existing clients.

**Technology Solutions**:
- **ASP.NET Core API Versioning**: Built-in support for URL path versioning (`/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`)
- **Controller Inheritance Pattern**: V2 controllers inherit from V1, automatically preserving all existing functionality
- **DTO Extension Pattern**: `ProductV2Dto : ProductDto` ensures all V1 fields remain present with identical structure
- **Separate MediatR Handlers**: Version-specific business logic while maintaining clear separation

**Benefits**:
- Zero breaking changes for existing clients
- Automatic inheritance of all V1 endpoints in V2
- Clear versioning strategy that scales infinitely
- Independent optimization per version

**Architecture Pattern**:
```csharp
// V2 automatically inherits all V1 endpoints
[ApiVersion("2.0")]
[Route("api/v{version:apiVersion}/products")]
public class ProductsV2Controller : ProductsV1Controller
{
    // Only new/enhanced endpoints need implementation
}
```

### 4. Upstream Service Resilience Requirements

**Business Need**: Handle upstream service failures gracefully while maintaining system stability.

**Technology Solutions**:
- **Polly Library**: Mature resilience patterns with retry, circuit breaker, and timeout policies
- **HttpClientFactory**: Connection pooling, lifecycle management, and configuration
- **Exponential Backoff + Jitter**: Prevents thundering herd problems during recovery
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fast-fail after 5 failures, 2-minute break duration, 30-second sampling window

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "ErpService": { "TimeoutSeconds": 15, "MaxRetries": 2 },
  "WarehouseService": { "TimeoutSeconds": 15, "MaxRetries": 2 },
  "CircuitBreaker": {
    "FailureThreshold": 5,
    "BreakDuration": "00:02:00",
    "SamplingDuration": 30
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents cascading failures across the system
- Fast failure detection and recovery
- Reduces resource consumption during outages
- Unified resilience strategy across all upstream services

### 5. Secret Information Security Requirements

**Business Need**: Secure management of sensitive configuration data and API keys.

**Technology Solutions**:
- **Azure Key Vault**: Enterprise-grade secret management with access logging and rotation
- **DefaultAzureCredential**: Unified authentication across development and production environments
- **Environment Variable Separation**: Clear distinction between development and production secrets
- **Configuration Validation**: Startup-time validation of critical configuration values

**Implementation**:
```csharp
// Automatic credential chain: Managed Identity → Azure CLI → Visual Studio
builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVault(
    new Uri(keyVaultUri),
    new DefaultAzureCredential());
```

**Benefits**:
- Centralized secret management across environments
- Automatic rotation and access auditing
- Zero secrets in source code or configuration files
- Seamless development-to-production workflow

### 6. Unified Logging and Exception Management Requirements

**Business Need**: Comprehensive observability for troubleshooting integration issues and performance monitoring.

**Technology Solutions**:
- **Application Insights**: Enterprise-grade telemetry with automatic dependency tracking
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format with correlation IDs for cross-service tracing
- **MediatR Pipeline Behaviors**: Business-level logging with request/response context
- **Custom Telemetry**: Performance metrics, cache hit ratios, and business operation tracking

**Observability Stack**:
```csharp
// Automatic correlation across service boundaries
services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(options =>
{
    options.ConnectionString = appInsightsConnectionString;
    options.EnableDependencyTrackingTelemetryModule = true;
});

// Business-level logging in MediatR pipeline
public class LoggingBehaviour<TRequest, TResponse> : IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
```

**Benefits**:
- End-to-end request tracing across all components
- Automatic performance monitoring and alerting
- Rich context for debugging integration issues
- Proactive issue detection before user impact

### 7. Code Quality and Maintainability Requirements

**Business Need**: Maintain high code quality, reduce technical debt, and ensure long-term maintainability.

**Technology Solutions**:
- **Clean Architecture + CQRS**: Clear separation between commands, queries, and business logic
- **MediatR**: Decoupled request/response handling with pipeline behaviors for cross-cutting concerns
- **FluentValidation**: Type-safe, testable validation rules with clear error messages
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in IoC container for loose coupling and testability
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and behavior-driven testing strategies

**Architecture Benefits**:
```csharp
// Clear separation of concerns
public record GetProductQuery(string Id) : IRequest<ProductDto?>;
public class GetProductQueryHandler : IRequestHandler<GetProductQuery, ProductDto?>
public class GetProductQueryValidator : AbstractValidator<GetProductQuery>
```

**Quality Assurance**:
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection reduces runtime issues
- **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested in isolation
- **Maintainability**: Clear patterns reduce cognitive load for new developers
- **Extensibility**: New features follow established patterns consistently
